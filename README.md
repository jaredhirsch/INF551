# INF551

Working through the course associated with Program = Proof by Mimram,
and digging into Ocaml, Agda, and the Curry-Howard correspondence more broadly.

## Ocaml resources I've found along the way

Standard ocaml books seem to be:

* Whitington, OCaML from the very beginning (available [free online](https://johnwhitington.net/ocamlfromtheverybeginning/mlbook.pdf))
* Whitington, More OCaml
* Real World Ocaml (available [free online](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/))
* Developing applications with Objective Caml 
* OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful (available [free online](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html))
  * This is an academic course, with associated video lectures and problem sets

## Agda / theorem prover resources I've found along the way

* See huge list of Agda resources in [the Agda docs](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.2.1/getting-started/tutorial-list.html)

## Note

I'm not sure if I should be publishing solutions to an active course,
will have to think that through as I go along here.
